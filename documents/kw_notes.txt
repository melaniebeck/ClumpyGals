"Clumpy" galaxies in Stripe 82 from GZ: Hubble morphologies
working with Claudia Scarlata, Steven Vanderhei, Ali Swancutt (UMN)

"clumpy" = f_features,weighted >= 0.50 AND f_clumpy,weighted >= 0.50 AND N_clumpy,weighted >= 20

The above definition is my off-the-cuff threshold; not empirically determined, but intended to get a relatively
    clean sample of the clumpiest galaxies. 


single-epoch Stripe 82 data: 144 clumpy galaxies
coadded Stripe 82 data:      145 clumpy galaxies

    Matching the two samples against each other by position (3 arcsec), 
    only 34 galaxies are defined as clumpy in both single-epoch and coadded imaging.

110 galaxies are clumpy in single-epoch but not coadded images

      5 have no image in the coadded data
    105 have a coadded image, but it does not meet the criteria for "clumpy"

111 galaxies are clumpy in coadded but not single-epoch images

     48 have no image in the single-epoch data
     63 have a single-epoch image, but it does not meet the criteria for "clumpy"


For the 105 galaxies that are clumpy in single-epoch but not coadded:

    mean f_features,weighted = 0.480        (75% do not meet the criteria of >= 0.50)
    mean f_clumpy,weighted   = 0.659        (30% do not meet the criteria of >= 0.50)
    mean N_clumpy,weighted   = 12.4         (95% do not meet the criteria of >= 20)

    All but 4 galaxies have N_clumpy,weighted <= 20; 
    those 4 all have f_features,weighted between 0.45 and 0.50

    If threshold on N_clumpy,weighted is lowered to 10: 20 additional galaxies meet 50%,50% criteria for clumpy
    If threshold on N_clumpy,weighted is lowered to  0: same result as for N >= 10

For the 63 galaxies that are clumpy in coadded but not single-epoch:

    mean f_features,weighted = 0.427        ( 80% do not meet the criteria of >= 0.50)
    mean f_clumpy,weighted   = 0.690        ( 30% do not meet the criteria of >= 0.50)
    mean N_clumpy,weighted   = 12.2         (100% do not meet the criteria of >= 20)

    All galaxies have N_clumpy,weighted <= 20

    If threshold on N_clumpy,weighted is lowered to 10: 14 additional galaxies meet 50%,50% criteria for clumpy
    If threshold on N_clumpy,weighted is lowered to  0: same result as for N >= 10
